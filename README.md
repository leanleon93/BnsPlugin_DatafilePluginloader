# BnsPlugin_DatafilePluginloader

A plugin for BnS NEO that enables dynamic loading and hot-reloading of "datafile plugins" at runtime.

---

## Overview

**BnsPlugin_DatafilePluginloader** acts as an additional plugin loader for BnS NEO, allowing you to load, update, and reload lightweight datafile hook plugins without restarting the game. For clarity, this layer is referred to as "datafile plugins" throughout this readme.

## Features

- **Hot-reloadable plugins:** Add, update, or remove datafile plugins (DLLs) at runtime.
- **Direct data hooks:** Intercept the game's "find data" process for real-time data reading and modification.
- **ImGui integration:** Easily add custom configuration UIs for your plugins.
- **No restart required:** Reload all plugins instantly from the in-game UI.

---

## How It Works

- The DatafilePluginloader is a standard BnS plugin (DLL) that hooks into the game via the existing pilao pluginloader (`winmm.dll`).
- Datafile plugins can hook into the game's data table access, enabling on-the-fly data manipulation.
- The loader provides an ImGui-based UI for plugin configuration and management.

---

## Usage

1. **Install datafile pluginloader:**
   - Place `DatafilePluginloader.dll` into the `plugins` folder of your BnS NEO installation (where `BNSR.exe` is located).

2. **Create the plugin folder:**
   - In the same directory as `BNSR.exe`, create a folder named `datafilePlugins` (next to the existing `plugins` folder).

3. **Add your plugins:**
   - Place your datafile plugin DLLs into the `datafilePlugins` folder.

4. **In-game controls:**
   - Press `INSERT` to open the settings UI.
   - Click `Reload all plugins` to refresh plugins without restarting the game.

## Notes

This project was created to explore the idea of a hot-reloadable datafile pluginloader with integrated GUI support. It is shared in the hope that others find it useful or inspiring.
